```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Starting up

1. Started by creating a new repository on my GitHub site (https://github.com/cmlegault/WKFORBIAS).  
1. Created a new project in RStudio and put these default files into the GitHub repository.
1. Decided to use testthat package so created tests/testthat directory for all the tests.
1. Created a Shiny app that can be called by function runShiny, note the directory structure required for this.
1. From the start used roxygen for creating the documentation of functions.
1. Need to have devtools and usethis installed.

## My workflow during development

1. Copy the URL from the Clone or download (green) button on the GitHub page.
1. Create new project in RStudio, pasting in URL (have to make sure no local copy).
1. If already have local copy, can Git/Pull in upper left window of RStudio to make sure updated.
1. In Build tab of RStudio upper right panel, click "Install and Restart" button.
1. In Console, type devtools::test() to make sure everything is still working (everything should pass).
1. In R/exampleWorkflow.R file, uncomment code and run to see if things are still working.
1. usethis::use_version() and increment last field (development)
1. Begin editing files or creating new files.
1. Be sure to use devtools::document() to keep man pages up to date.
1. Modify DESCRIPTION suggests line if need more packages.
1. Install and Restart before testing so most recent changes are included in tests.
1. Try to make functions as small as possible and as bulletproof as possible. Think about what can make them break.
1. Have fun!
1. Repeat steps 4-12 as often as possible.
1. Git/Commit often.
1. Occasionally in Build tab run Check to make sure everything passes CRAN muster. (Note this file doesn't, but not a big deal.) Can also do this in Console using devtools::check().

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
